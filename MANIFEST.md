# Pharo wiki manifest

This file will explain the goals of this project and define its perimeter. 

Pharo-wiki is a user-maintained wiki around the programming language and development environment Pharo as well as its ecosystem.

Here is a list of the goals of the project:
- Provide documentation on parts of Pharo that are not yet or poorly documented
- Provide a centralized source of information on Pharo
- Provide pointers to existing documentation
- Provide tips on possible workflow on Pharo using all the strength of the environment
- Provide references to external libraries
- Provide migration guides between different versions of Pharo
- The project should be easy to contribute to (with a GitHub account the user should have to edit a file on the GitHub interface to contribute)

To be easy to contribute, this project is written in Markdown and hosted on GitHub. Anyone with a GitHub account can easily provide a Pull Request. (See [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION.md))

To answer the goal, the project is divided into four sections.

* The first section contains pages describing some of Pharo mechanisms and guide on possible workflows.
* The second section includes documentation on subprojects contained in Pharo general distribution.
* The third section includes information about external projects. Most of the pages give some examples to give an idea of how those project works and offer comparisons between multiple projects around the same theme.
* The fourth section contains migration guides between different versions of Pharo.

As long as it fits the goal of the wiki, the entries of this project can be:
- Documentations
- Tutorials
- Guides
- Tips and tricks
